    The CSP should treat all GÉANT User data as though it were
    confidential regardless of its classification by the GÉANT User. It
    is anticipated that CSPs will be required to evidence that they will
    cascade this responsibility down its supply chain to all relevant
    3rd parties. It is also anticipated that GÉANT User will expect CSPs
    to make every effort to safeguard data access and the interests of
    the GÉANT Users at all times. CSPs will be expected to ensure that
    all staff sign a confidentiality statement regarding confidential
    data.

    Where a request for access to GÉANT User data comes from a
    recognised government authority, the CSP will be expected to check
    what their actual legal obligation is before they comply with the
    request. GÉANT Users do not expect the CSP to cooperate where no
    legal obligation exists and thus deny the request. Where a
    legitimate request is received, the CSP should only release a
    minimum data set and in all cases will be expected to inform the
    affected GÉANT User as soon as possible.

    The CSP should notify the GÉANT User immediately it becomes aware
    of a suspected or actual breach of confidentiality, loss of data,
    breach of the security measures, deterioration of the service, or
    downtime of the service. The CSP will take all necessary measures,
    at its own cost, to secure the data and to rectify the
    shortcomings in the security measures so as to prevent any further
    perusal, alteration, or provision, without prejudice to any right
    of the GÉANT User to damages or other measures. Following such an
    incident, at the GÉANT User’s reasonable request, the CSP will
    cooperate with the provision of information about the incident and
    its resolution to concerned parties.

    Companies operating in the European Union are not allowed to send

    of protection. The Safe Harbour Privacy Principles allow US
    companies to register their certification if they meet the
    European Union requirements. Ahead of any actual committed
    contract, the GÉANT Customer will require the ability to request
    certificates of independent security audit to confirm that the
    CSPs processes are in accordance with the applicable legislation.
    For CSPs based in the USA, it will be mandatory that they are Safe
    Harbour certified. Note that for CSPs based in the EU, the USA,
    the European Economic Area (EEA) or countries which the European
    Commission considers to have acceptable levels of data protection;

    acceptable to the GÉANT User. It will also need to be deleted from
    all CSP sites, including backup sites, by the current CSP. At the
    request of the GÉANT User, all data will be made available to
    subsequent CSP without additional charge. The outgoing CSP will be
    required to ensure that all data will be exported in such way that
    there will be no loss of functionality of the data or any parts of
    the data. In case of CSPs filing for bankruptcy the data will have
    to be accessible for three months after the day of bankruptcy
    filing.

    confidentiality, integrity, availability, effectiveness, and

    It is anticipated that a high quality network connection will be
    required. The community’s preference is typically that CSP will
    connect their networks directly to GÉANT (recommended) or specific
    a NREN’s network infrastructure in order to overcome potential
    issues with latency, bandwidth, data loss, or any other
    degradation of network connectivity. All peering should be done in
    accordance with the GÉANT Peering Policy in one of the designated
    GÉANT PoPs. GÉANT considers networking peering to be a win-win
    solution for both parties, and discourages its customers from
    accepting connectivity fees aside from any relevant connection
    cost recovery fee. CSPs that charge end users for networking
    connectivity and/or usage, should not impose such charges if the
    user is coming from GÉANT network. Is network peering acceptable
    to the CSP under said terms and conditions?
