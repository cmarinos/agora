detecting and repairing problems affecting the operation of the CS and
the improvement of features that involve the detection of, and
protection against, emerging and evolving threats to the user (such as
malware or spam).

# Legal Aspects

## National Law Governance

If requested by Institution, CSP has to grant Institution ability to
sign Agreement under its national law.

## Concordance with National Privacy Act(s)

If requested by Institution, the CSP will produce yearly verification
of compliance of private data security in provided CS, as requested by
the Institutions national privacy act.

## External Security Audit Certificate

Before signing the actual Agreement, the Institution has to have
ability to request certificate of external security audit that depends
on the ownership of the CSP.

For CSPs based in USA, it is mandatory that they are Safe Harbour certified. 

For CSPs based in EU, USA, European Economic Area (EEA) or countries
which the European Commission considers to have acceptable levels of
data protection , it is safe to assume that there is always personal
data involved (user accounts).

the type of CS offered. In general, this means that the CS will be
available to Users for at least 99%, that the users will be notified

physical and logical security of the CS so as to prevent any loss or
damage and any form of unauthorized access, alteration, or provision,
or any other wrongful processing of the Institutions Data. The

# Confidentiality

##Data Protection

The CSP will treat confidential Data as confidential. This will concern

interests of the Institution in case the authorities requested access
to Data. The CSP will check if there is a legal obligation to comply with
the request and will not cooperate if there is no legal obligation.
The CSP will object to the request when appropriate, and will release only
a minimum data set; no more than necessary. The CSP is obliged to inform
owner of the Data (Institution) as soon as possible.

# Personnel

The CSP will be make sure that all people it employs must sign a
confidentiality statement regarding confidential data.

# Penalty

For every contravention of its confidentiality obligation, CSP will
owe an immediately due and payable penalty, no less then one month of
service fees, without this affecting Institution's other rights to
receive damages.

# Communication

## Supervision

At the written request of The Institution, the CSP will cooperate with the
exercise of supervision by or on behalf of Institution of the CS and
use of confidential Data by the CSP.

## Data Availability

The CSP will make all Data that it has in its possession in the
context of performance of the Agreement available to Institution at

The CSP is obliged to have an annual review of CSP's organization
carried out by an independent EDP auditor or expert that it designates
in order to determine: that the CSP can comply with the provisions of the
present Agreement regarding the protection of Data (including Personal
Data and privacy aspects); that the CSP is able to comply with the
provisions of the present Agreement regarding the confidentiality,
integrity, continuity, effectiveness, and efficiency of the CS made
available by the CSP.

The CSP has the possibility to aggregate summary audit report for all
institutions under GÉANT umbrella and deliver it directly to GÉANT
Cloud Operations Team, or to offer this report  to Institution
directly.

## Quality Review

If the Institution has a reasonable suspicion that provisions of the
Agreement are not being complied with, the Institution may request the
CSP to have a quality review carried out. Prior to the review process,
the Institution and the CSP will agree on who will perform it and
estimate costs of the review process. The costs for such quality
review shall be borne by the Institution unless the findings of said
review show that the CSP has failed to comply with the provisions of the
Agreement. If that is the case, the costs will be borne by CSP.

The CSP will report periodically to Institution on data security and
any security incidents in the last period.

The CSP will provide adequate and timely information regarding new
releases (updates, release calendar) and the roadmap of the CS.

# Notification

The CSP will notify the Institution immediately if it becomes aware of
a suspected or actual breach of confidentiality, loss of confidential
Data, breach of the security measures, detoriation of the service, or
downtime of the service. The CSP will take all necessary measures, at its
own cost, to secure the confidential Data and to rectify the
shortcomings in the security measures so as to prevent any further
perusal, alteration, or provision, without prejudice to any right of
Institution to damages or other measures. At the Institution's request,
the CSP will cooperate with the provision of information to concerned
parties.

# Billing

A Billing infrastructure must support cost-effective invoicing/payment
processing and include hierarchical roles for NRENs (national and
regional ones), institutions which are NRENs institutional users
(Universities, Research Institutes, Schools, etc.).

# Technical Requirements

## AAI

If appropriate, and usually requested for the CSs that end-Users use,
the CS will support authentication provided by eduGAIN, which is the
standardised pan-European SAML-based authentication and authorization
infrastructure for single-sign on/off.

## User Provisioning

If there is a need to pre-provision users, the CSP will provide practical
provisioning methods, e.g. auto-provisioning, batch-provisioning, or
similar.

## Reporting / Metering / Sales Estimates

The CSP is requested to implement appropriate means of metering
current usage of the CSs, appropriate reporting facilities and
monthly/yearly sales estimates, which are updated dynamically. All
reports should be made available online and they need to be available
per site, Institution, or User.

## Network Connectivity and Associated Networking Costs

Depending on the type of CS in concern (mostly IaaS services, but also
applicable to other services, depending on the need of a excellent
quality network connection), the CSP should connect its network
directly to GÉANT (recommended) or NRENs network infrastructure, to
overcome potential issues with latency, bandwidth, data loss, or any
other degradation of network connectivity. Peering will also benefit
the CSP with the speedy diagnosis and resolution of service
disruptions.

Network peering should be done in accordance with GÉANT Peering Policy
in one of designated GÉANT PoPs. GÉANT considers networking peering to
be a win-win solution for both parties. Except for the connection cost
recovery fee, CSP will not impose any additional fees to GÉANT, NREN,
Institution or end users. CSPs that charge end users for networking
connectivity and/or usage, should not impose such charges if the user
is coming from GÉANT network.
